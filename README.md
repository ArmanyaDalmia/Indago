# Indago
 Discord Bot with the purpose of improving a students life on the platform!
 
 Uses the AnkiConnect API to allow students to connect their Anki accounts and practice flashcards interactively with everyone on the server, or individually! 
 
 Allows users to create multiple personal schedules which they can keep updated and have read out to them. 
 
 Users can also make use of the translation function to translate a given input to any language, and apart from the productivity functions the bot can also come into a voice     channel and play audio from YouTube videos!
